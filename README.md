## What is CS50P?

CS50P is an introduction to programming using Python, offered by Harvard University through edX.  
The course focuses on building strong programming fundamentals, computational thinking skills, and problem-solving abilities.

This course is part of my preparation for CS50x and AI-related academic programs.

## What This Repository Contains

✅ Lecture-based practice files  
✅ Weekly problem sets  
✅ Labs and mini projects  
✅ Final project (after completion)  
✅ Clean and documented Python code  

This repository is used to track my weekly progress and store my official CS50P solutions.

## Learning Objectives

- Build strong Python programming fundamentals  
- Improve algorithmic and logical thinking  
- Write clean and efficient code  
- Prepare for CS50x and AI-focused coursework

## Academic Honesty Notice

These solutions are published for learning and portfolio purposes.  
If you are taking CS50P, it is strongly recommended that you attempt the problem sets on your own before reviewing any solutions. True learning comes from solving problems independently.
